# Chaserz
Scooter race game mixing online/real-life experience.

## Why?
The app was developed as a part of Le Wagon Bootcamp (batch #209) with my colleague [Roni](https://github.com/ronitalvi). It is a browser based race game for scooter owners wich combines online and real-life experience. This project has been done as proof of concept. Main trick was to collect geodata from the racers at the server and broadcast it to them back, so each can see the position of others on the map.
